Q.1) Create a dataframe with columns player & score that having values 'NA'. & try the following functions on it.
  player=c("abc","xyz","pqr","ntr","sad")
> score=c(NA,34,45,65,NA)
> df = data.frame(player,score)
> df
  player score
1    abc    NA
2    xyz    34
3    pqr    45
4    ntr    65
5    sad    NA
> is.NA(df)
Error in is.NA(df) : could not find function "is.NA"
> is.na(df)
     player score
[1,]  FALSE  TRUE
[2,]  FALSE FALSE
[3,]  FALSE FALSE
[4,]  FALSE FALSE
[5,]  FALSE  TRUE
> table(is.na(df))

df[!complete.cases(df),]
  player score
1    abc    NA
5    sad    NA

FALSE  TRUE 
    8     2 
 mean(df$score,na.rm=TRUE)
[1] 48

newdf=na.omit(df)
> newdf
  player score
2    xyz    34
3    pqr    45
4    ntr    65


Q.2) Consider a vector [1:k] where 'k' is a positive integer. display how many integers in the vector are exactly divisible by 3.
 intvector = c(2,3,6,7,12,34,94)
> intvector = c(1:23)
> intvector
 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23
factor = function(vect)
+ {
+     for(i in vect)
+     {
+         if(i%%3==0)
+         {
+             print(i)
+         }
+     } 
+ }
> factor(intvector)
[1] 3
[1] 6
[1] 9
[1] 12
[1] 15
[1] 18
[1] 21


Q.3) consider a vector having 6 values, out of which 2 values are 'NA'
  i) display length of vector.
> v
[1]  1 NA  9  2  3 NA
> length(v)
[1] 6
  ii) remove all occurences of 'NA' in the vector.
 v1 = na.omit(v)
> v1
[1] 1 9 2 3
attr(,"na.action")
[1] 2 6
attr(,"class")
[1] "omit"
  iii) replace all occurences of 'NA' with an integer value
	count=c(1:6)
	replace = function(v,intvector)
	{
  	for(i in count)
	{
    	  if(v[i] == NA)
          {
            v[i]<-intvector[i]
          }
        }
       }
  iv)  write a code that will return TRUE if it has missing values.

Q.4) consider a vector which has 10 integer values out of which 3 are missaing values, caluculate sum of the vector.
v2 = c(5,32,NA,34,NA,11,NA,16,12,1)
> sum(v2,na.rm=TRUE)
[1] 111

Q.5) consider a dataframe with names,sales & price. write a code that will return dataframe which removes all rows with missing values under names columns.

Q.6) Load Orange dataset, replace all values of age 118 to 'NA'.

Q.7) Consider dataset VADeaths. check wheather an object is dataframe or not. if object is not a dataframe convert it into a dataframe.
     create a new variable total which is sum of each row.

Q.8) consider dataset Swiss. create a dataframe of only folowing rows:
     1,2,3,10,11,12,13 and only variable examination, education, infant mortality.
	i) infant mortality of SARINE is wrong is should be set to 'NA'.
	ii) create a row that will be total sum of the columns & name it as total.

Q.9) Use dataset MPCars save it in a variable.
	i) Use logical operators to output only those rows of variable wher column mpg is between 15 & 20(excluding 15 & 20)
	ii) Use logical operator to output only those rows of variable where column cyl = 6 & clumn am is not 0.
	iii) Use logical operator to output column gear or car has the value 4.
	iv) Use logical operator to putput only the even rows.
	v) use  logical operator & change  every 4th element in the column in mpg to 0.
	ii)
